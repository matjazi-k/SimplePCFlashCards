# READ ME
To run compile and run Main.java ("javac Main.java" then "java Main" in the terminal)

This program allows you to make simple flashcards. A word (or more) on one side and the expect answers on the other side (figuratively, not graphically).

After you've created your flashcards, you can start learning. The program outputs them in a random order, showing each card once (unless set to true random).

If you're struggling with certain words, the program allows you to make a set of words, and you can toggle the set on or off.

Due to this being a personal project, it is tuned to learning the German language.

# German and Slovene

There are some German specific commands in this program. An example is !defi and !konj . These commands either search the translation of the inputed word from SLO to GER or reverse, or they conjugate the verb into all it's relevant forms in German.

These are not made with multiple languages in mind, so these two languages are the only ones that work.

## Ignoring limitations

Even if these are the only two officially supported languages, the flashcards can still be used for any other implication, if we exclude these two commands.

# Running the program
To make using the program simpler, I made a simple run.bat, so even non developers know how to run it. Due to this being a personal project, JDK is required to run the program.

# Commands
Use: !, !h or !help to get a list of all the commands built into the program.
